This is the Python implementation of [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev), a vendor-agnostic abstraction library for evaluating feature flags.

We support multiple data types for flags (numbers, strings, booleans, objects) as well as hooks, which can alter the lifecycle of a flag evaluation.

This library is intended to be used in server-side contexts and has not been evaluated for use in mobile devices.

## Usage

While Boolean provides the simplest introduction, we offer a variety of flag types.

```python
# Depending on the flag type, use one of the methods below
flag_key = "PROVIDER_FLAG"
boolean_result = open_feature_client.get_boolean_value(key=flag_key,default_value=False)
integer_result = open_feature_client.get_integer_value(key=flag_key,default_value=-1)
float_result = open_feature_client.get_float_value(key=flag_key,default_value=-1)
string_result = open_feature_client.get_string_value(key=flag_key,default_value="")
object_result = open_feature_client.get_object_value(key=flag_key,default_value={})
```

Each provider class may have further setup required i.e. secret keys, environment variables etc

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

## Installation

### Add it to your build

<!---x-release-please-start-version-->

Pip install

```bash
pip install openfeature-sdk==0.0.9
```

requirements.txt

```bash
openfeature-sdk==0.0.9
```

```python
pip install requirements.txt
```

<!---x-release-please-end-->

### Configure it

In order to use the sdk there is some minor configuration. Follow the script below:

```python
from open_feature import open_feature_api
from open_feature.provider.no_op_provider import NoOpProvider

open_feature_api.set_provider(NoOpProvider())
open_feature_client = open_feature_api.get_client()
```

## Contacting us

We hold regular meetings which you can see [here](https://github.com/open-feature/community/#meetings-and-events).

We are also present on the `#openfeature` channel in the [CNCF slack](https://slack.cncf.io/).
