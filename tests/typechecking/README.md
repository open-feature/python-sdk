# Type Checking Tests

This directory contains type checking validation files that are designed to be checked by **type checkers only**, not executed by pytest.

## Purpose

These files validate that the type annotations work correctly through static analysis.
They ensure type safety for complex type definitions like `EvaluationContextAttribute` and other typed interfaces.
