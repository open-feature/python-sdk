### Providers

[Providers](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/provider) are an abstraction between a flag management system and the OpenFeature SDK.
Look [here](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=python) for a complete list of available providers.
If the provider you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a provider](#develop-a-provider) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a provider as a dependency, it can be registered with OpenFeature like this:

```python
from openfeature import api
from openfeature.provider.no_op_provider import NoOpProvider

api.set_provider(NoOpProvider())
open_feature_client = api.get_client()
```

<!-- In some situations, it may be beneficial to register multiple providers in the same application.
This is possible using [named clients](#named-clients), which is covered in more detail below. -->

### Targeting

Sometimes, the value of a flag must consider some dynamic criteria about the application or user, such as the user's location, IP, email address, or the server's location.
In OpenFeature, we refer to this as [targeting](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary#targeting).
If the flag management system you're using supports targeting, you can provide the input data using the [evaluation context](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context).

```python
from openfeature.api import (
    get_client,
    get_provider,
    set_provider,
    get_evaluation_context,
    set_evaluation_context,
)

global_context = EvaluationContext(
    targeting_key="targeting_key1", attributes={"application": "value1"}
)
request_context = EvaluationContext(
    targeting_key="targeting_key2", attributes={"email": request.form['email']}
)

## set global context
set_evaluation_context(global_context)

# merge second context
client = get_client(name="No-op Provider")
client.get_string_value("email", "fallback", request_context)
```

### Hooks

[Hooks](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/hooks) allow for custom logic to be added at well-defined points of the flag evaluation life-cycle.
Look [here](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem/?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Hook&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=python) for a complete list of available hooks.
If the hook you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a hook](#develop-a-hook) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a hook as a dependency, it can be registered at the global, client, or flag invocation level.

```python
from openfeature.api import add_hooks
from openfeature.flag_evaluation import FlagEvaluationOptions

# set global hooks at the API-level
add_hooks([MyHook()])

# or configure them in the client
client = OpenFeatureClient()
client.add_hooks([MyHook()])

# or at the invocation-level
options = FlagEvaluationOptions(hooks=[MyHook()])
client.get_boolean_flag("my-flag", False, flag_evaluation_options=options)
```

### Logging

Logging customization is not yet available in the Python SDK.

### Named clients

Named clients are not yet available in the Python SDK. Progress on this feature can be tracked [here](https://github.com/open-feature/python-sdk/issues/125).

### Eventing

Events are not yet available in the Python SDK. Progress on this feature can be tracked [here](https://github.com/open-feature/python-sdk/issues/125).

### Shutdown

A shutdown method is not yet available in the Python SDK. Progress on this feature can be tracked [here](https://github.com/open-feature/python-sdk/issues/125).

## Extending

### Develop a provider

To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/python-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
You‚Äôll then need to write the provider by implementing the `AbstractProvider` class exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

```python
from typing import List, Optional

from openfeature.evaluation_context import EvaluationContext
from openfeature.flag_evaluation import FlagResolutionDetails
from openfeature.provider.provider import AbstractProvider

class MyProvider(AbstractProvider):
    def get_metadata(self) -> Metadata:
        ...

    def get_provider_hooks(self) -> List[Hook]:
        return []

    def resolve_boolean_details(
        self,
        flag_key: str,
        default_value: bool,
        evaluation_context: Optional[EvaluationContext] = None,
    ) -> FlagResolutionDetails[bool]:
        ...

    def resolve_string_details(
        self,
        flag_key: str,
        default_value: str,
        evaluation_context: Optional[EvaluationContext] = None,
    ) -> FlagResolutionDetails[str]:
        ...

    def resolve_integer_details(
        self,
        flag_key: str,
        default_value: int,
        evaluation_context: Optional[EvaluationContext] = None,
    ) -> FlagResolutionDetails[int]:
        ...

    def resolve_float_details(
        self,
        flag_key: str,
        default_value: float,
        evaluation_context: Optional[EvaluationContext] = None,
    ) -> FlagResolutionDetails[float]:
        ...

    def resolve_object_details(
        self,
        flag_key: str,
        default_value: Union[dict, list],
        evaluation_context: Optional[EvaluationContext] = None,
    ) -> FlagResolutionDetails[Union[dict, list]]:
        ...
```

> Built a new provider? [Let us know](https://github.com/open-feature/openfeature.dev/issues/new?assignees=&labels=provider&projects=&template=document-provider.yaml&title=%5BProvider%5D%3A+) so we can add it to the docs!

### Develop a hook

To develop a hook, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/python-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
Implement your own hook by creating a hook that inherits from the `Hook` class.
Any of the evaluation life-cycle stages (`before`/`after`/`error`/`finally_after`) can be override to add the desired business logic.

```python
from openfeature.hook import Hook

class MyHook(Hook):
    def after(self, hook_context: HookContext, details: FlagEvaluationDetails, hints: dict):
        print("This runs after the flag has been evaluated")

```
